# Ramble Project Summary

## The idea
The ramble project aims to provide a way for individuals to think and brainstorm while walking. The speaker personally finds it helpful to think while walking and talking to themselves. However, listening to the recordings later becomes time-consuming due to pauses and other interruptions. To address this, the speaker plans to develop an app that allows users to record their thoughts while walking, automatically transcribe and summarize the recordings into markdown format. The summarized thoughts can then be easily reviewed and exported to various text editors and note-taking apps.

## Phase 1: Technical Implementation
In this phase, the speaker plans to tackle the technical aspects of the project. The first step involves uploading the audio recordings and converting them to text using AssemblyAI's API. The next step is to use OpenAI's GPT to convert the text into a meaningful summary in markdown format. The speaker has already completed the initial step of figuring out the AssemblyAI API.

## Phase 2: UI Development
Once the transcription and summarization process is established, the speaker intends to focus on building the user interface (UI). The UI will feature a record button that allows users to capture their thoughts verbally. When they stop recording, the app will automatically transcribe the audio, send it to OpenAI for summarization, and return the markdown summary. Users will be able to review the summary and export it via email.

## Phase 3: Integrations
In this phase, the speaker plans to explore integrations with popular note-taking apps, starting with Notion. The goal is to enable seamless integration of the summarized thoughts into these apps for easier organization and access to the recorded ideas.

## Phase 4: Live Transcription (Optional)
If time permits, the speaker considers adding live transcription as a feature. However, the speaker acknowledges that live transcription might not be a significant quality of life boost for users who primarily review recordings after the fact. Therefore, it may not be a high priority, but still an interesting feature to consider.

## Future Steps
After completing the planned phases, the speaker intends to gather feedback by sharing the app with others and assessing their thoughts and experiences.
